# mr-grep
Application for the concurrent/distributed grepping of text-content.

## Disclaimer
Portions of this codebase were not written by myself.
`mrcoordinator.go`, `mrworker.go`, as well as some signatures in the `mr` file are part of the MIT 6.5840 assignments. However, implementation of these signatures was done by myself. 

In addition, the `Map` and `Reduce` Grep methods were produced by Copilot. 
Implementations of other methods were sometimes debugged with Copilot.
